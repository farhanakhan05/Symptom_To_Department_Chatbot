# 🏥 Symptom-to-Department Chatbot (Machine Learning)

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Symptom-to-Department Chatbot** is a beginner-friendly **HealthTech Machine Learning project** that helps users identify the appropriate hospital department based on the symptoms they describe in natural language.

Patients often face confusion about which medical department to consult for their symptoms. This project aims to reduce that confusion by using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning classification** to map symptoms to relevant hospital departments.

⚠️ *This project is created for educational purposes only and does not provide medical diagnosis or treatment.*

## 🎯 Objectives
- Accept symptom descriptions as text input from users  
- Analyze the text using NLP techniques  
- Predict the most suitable hospital department  
- Demonstrate an end-to-end ML workflow for beginners  

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. A custom dataset of symptoms and departments is created in CSV format  
2. Symptom text is converted into numerical features using **TF-IDF**  
3. A **Naive Bayes classifier** is trained on the processed data  
4. User input symptoms are passed to the trained model  
5. The model predicts and displays the relevant hospital department
